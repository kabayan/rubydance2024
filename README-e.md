# Wow! technical background
Documentation on the creation of this video.

## Intent
- To see if it is possible to generate a critique of a work of art, rather than using it to create a work of art.
- The premise is that if the critique can be freely made by anyone who has viewed the work, it should not infringe on the artist's rights if it is made by a generative AI.
- Confirm the possibility that an AI can provide objective critiques (with limitations) that do not take into account personalities or human relationships.
- We wanted to compare the various AIs available as of July 2024 in terms of whether they could be used for critique.
- By releasing the created video as CC4.0, we wanted to be able to use it as a benchmark for comparing the critiquing performance of the generated AIs that will emerge in the future.

## Technology used
## Generative AI
- GPT4o(OpenAI)
  - Via Web
- Gemini Pro 1.5(Google)
  - Via Google AI Studio.
- Clude3(Anthropic)
  - Via Web
## AI related
- Text-to-Speech AI(Google)
- DeepL (Japanese-English)
## etc.
- Visual studio code, Python 3.10
- Davinci Resolve

## Build procedure
1. select music tracks and connect them
2. ask GPT4o to suggest a background color 3. give the music file to GPT4o for analysis
3. Give music files to GPT4o for analysis
   - Gemini.Clude cannot interpret the music. 4.
4. generate background video
   - Give background color information to Clude and generate program.
   - Gemini and GPT4o could not generate the program properly. 5.
5. take dance videos of each part.
6. create a short catch and critique
    - 6. generate dance video by giving it to Gemini.
    - Generated every 3 parts.
    - GPT4o and Clude3 could not generate. 7.
7. compilation of all critiques
    - Give GPT4o a summary of all three critiques together and generate a summary.
    - Gemini and Clude also generated it, but GPT4o was the most likely to do so. 8.
8. music, background video, dance video, catches, and critique were concatenated in Davinci Resolve.
